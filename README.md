# Installation guide


To install the MSSR plugin, first ensure you have the latest version of FIJI installed (https://fiji.sc/). Additionally, the CLIJ, CLIJ2, and CLIJx packages must be installed, as explained in the CLIJ2 documentation (https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/installationInFiji) (Figure panel c).


Plugin Installation Options:

	1.	Through FIJI: Select Plugins -> Install -> MSSR_X.X.X.jar.
	2.	Manual Installation: Place the MSSR_X.X.X.jar file in the FIJI plugins folder.

Estimated installation time is approximately 2-5 minutes, excluding download times.

# MSSR Plugin Overview

The MSSR plugin provides two main analysis options:

	1.	MSSR Analysis: Performs the primary processing for either sf-MSSRn or t-MSSRn.
	2.	Temporal Analysis: Conducts temporal analysis for a selected Point Temporal Function (PTF) for t-MSSRn processing.

In what follows the main parameters available for MSSR analysis computation will be explained, hence, description will be centered on the use of the MSSR Analysis tab of the MSSR plugin.


MSSR Analysis Parameters (Figure panel b.1):

The following parameters must be defined for the analysis:

	•	AMP: Defines the upscaling factor for image size.
	•	FWHM: Sets the number of pixels covering the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the imaging lens’s Point Spread Function (PSF).
	•	Order: Determines the number of MSSR iterations to enhance image resolution.

The plugin offers the option of computing 𝑠𝑓−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛, or both 𝑠𝑓−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛 and 𝑡−𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑛. The temporal analysis is enabled when selecting the option “MSSR Temporal analysis” (Figure panel b.3) where the user can choose one of five available PTFs: Mean, Variance (Var), Temporal Product Mean (TPM), Coefficient Variation, Auto-cumulant Function of order 2-4 (SOFI 2-4).

Additional Features:


	•	FWHM Computation: Provides an estimation of the Rayleigh criterion based on optical parameters (Figure panel c).
	•	Interpolation Type: Offers ‘Bicubic’ as the default option for image magnification.
	•	Mesh Minimization: Reduces mesh artifacts from bicubic interpolation (Figure panel b.2.
	•	GPU Computing: Enables GPU processing for enhanced performance (Figure panel b.2).
	•	Intensity Normalization: Allows pixel-wise scaling of MSSR images with the magnified original image (Figure panel b.2).
	•	Image Selection: Allows choosing an image or stack for analysis (Figure panel b.3).
	•	Batch Analysis: Enables automatic processing of all images in a selected folder (Figure panel b.3).

# Instructions for use

1. Open ImageJ

2. Open the dataset *test_image.tif*.

3. Go to Plugins -> MSSR -> MSSR Analysis
A window will open.

4. Define the parameters, and additional features.

5. Click on "OK" button.

6. After a few seconds (depending on the specifications of your computer, the defined parameters and the data to be analyzed it might take longer), one or two images will appear (two if a temporal analysis is selected).

-------------------
# Demo

Open the image of interest in ImageJ and make sure it is the active window.

The plugin supports multidimensional stacks of any bit depth (The resulting images will be 32-bit).

Define the three main parameters. Select additional features at your convenience.
Selection a temporal analysis will generate two images, one for the processed stack and other por the temporal stack projection.
